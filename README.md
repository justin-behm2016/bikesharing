## Overview
* The goal of this project was to analyze New York City citibike data to create visualizations for possible investors for a similar service in Des Moines. The data was analyzed for a variety of factors to gain a better overview of ways to make this citibike venture sustainable and profitable. By analyzing the data for several factors, the goal is to find a way to apply the successes of New York City's program to the city of Des Moines.


### Results
* The first visualization depicts the total number of rides for the month of August next to a map displaying the top starting locations. There is a caveat of potentially skewed numbers due to an influx of tourists in this location, and there is a legend available to clarify how the color and size of the circles corresponds to the amount of rides in that area.
* The second visualization shows the total amount of users compared to the hour of the day, on a 24-hour scale. Hour brackets of 2AM - 5AM have been identified as a potential time for maintanence due to lower average user amounts, and the bracket of 5PM - 7PM has been identified as a peak time for users.
* The third visualization illustrates the amount of users based on trip duration, with a large spike within the 1 hour or less trip duration section of the graph.
* The following graph advances the previous graph by also including statistics based on user-gender, with the options being "MALE", "FEMALE", and "UNKNOWN".
* Next we have a heat graph with colors corresponding to user activity based on day of the week and hour of the day. There are darker areas on Thursday and Friday afternoons, around 5PM on both days, corresponding to a higher number of active users.
* The following heatmap advances the previous one by once again including statistics on user-gender. For example, Thursdays at 5PM and 6PM show a high spike in male user activity.
* The final visualization further narrows down the previous heatmaps. This graph also includes information based on user-type. The upper area of the map is dedicated to regular customers while the bottom area is dedicated to subscribers. The graph shows a strong concentration of male users in the subscriber data. 


#### Summary
* The data shows a high level of success with creating a bike sharing company in New York City. There are over 2 million users in the month of August, with a large number of them being subscribed users. There is a possibility of a large influx on tourist users in this dataset, but given the number of recurring subscribed users it would suggest the business model is still successful. 
* There are several further visualizations I would recommend creating before moving forward. I would consider looking furhter into ending locations and the distances between user starting and ending locations. Depending on the mileage of the average user ride, there could be a rewards system put in place for distances traveled by users, creating further incentive for recurring subscribers while also incentivizing new customers to go for a longer ride during their more rare usage.
* Finally, I would suggest a "tourist option" within the program. This would involve a visualization based on where non-subscriber users often pause their rides or stop and restart their rides. Then the visualization could be advanced to include a programmed route that takes new users through the most popular viewing points in the city.
